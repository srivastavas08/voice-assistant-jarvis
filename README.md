# voice-assistant-jarvis
Its a Voice Assistant based on python and its libraries
for libraries refer requirements.txt
Create a virtual environment and install all the supporting libraries using pip or pinenv which ever suits you
I had used many API's all are from free source 
Go through my code and follow the instructions to add the Api key 
Replace the ApI key in place of # in the code.
Now run the jarvis.py file
Make sure before running this file your Microphone and speakers are connected properly
